# Movies Recommender System

## Overview

Welcome to the Movie Recommender System! This project aims to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences. The system uses a pre-trained model for recommending movies, deployed with Streamlit for an interactive user interface.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Get movie recommendations tailored to your tastes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interact with the recommender system through a simple and intuitive Streamlit interface.
- **Efficient Model**: The recommender system is powered by a vectorization-based model for accurate and fast recommendations.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used for development.
- **Pickle**: Used for serializing and deserializing the trained model.
- **Streamlit**: A web application framework used for deploying the recommender system.
- **Vectorization**: Used for training the recommendation model.

## Installation

To get started with the Movie Recommender System, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movies-recommender-system.git
   cd movies-recommender-system

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py

  # Usage
## 1. Open the Application:
Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to the local server address provided by Streamlit (typically http://localhost:8501).

## 2. Get Recommendations:
Enter your favorite movie or a list of movies you like, and the system will provide you with a list of recommended movies based on your input.

# Model Training
The recommendation model is trained using vectorization techniques to analyze and understand movie features and user preferences. The trained model is then saved using Pickle for easy deployment.
